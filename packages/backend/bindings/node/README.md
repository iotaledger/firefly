# Node.js binding

This is the Node.js binding to the wallet backend. It's written using [neon](https://neon-bindings.com/).

## Installation

### macOS

The development dependencies for macOS are:

-   Python 2.7
-   Xcode
-   Install the Command Line Tools via Xcode under the menu Xcode → Preferences → Downloads.

### Windows

-   Install all the required tools and configurations using Microsoft's `windows-build-tools` package (from an elevated terminal):
    `$ npm install --global windows-build-tools`
-   Set the python path:
    `$ npm config set python python2.7`
-   Download Visual Studio with the `Desktop development with C++` workload or Visual Studio Build Tools for C++.
-   Define the msvs_version variable so node-gyp can find Visual Studio:
    `$ npm config set msvs_version 2019` # `2019` is the year of the installed Microsoft Visual Studio

### Unix

-   Python 2.7 (Python 3 is not supported)
-   make
-   A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like GCC
