# Documentation

## Purpose

This document details the standard operating procedure (SOP) for maintaining and modifying Firefly documentation (handbook *and* the GitHub wiki).

## Scope

This SOP is applicable to contributors to the Firefly repository, mainly the core Firefly development team.

## Responsibilities

All members of the Firefly team are responsible for mainintaing documentation, specifically in ensuring its accuracy and relevancy, as we all use this resource and benefit from it being of the highest possible quality.

## Processes

- [Handbook](#handbook)
- [GitHub Wiki](#github-wiki)

## Handbook

### Creating a Task

To make changes to the documentation within this handbook, begin the process by creating a GitHub task specifically for your desired changes. Please use the "Continuously improve documentation" milestone when creating the task.

If the suggested changes are akin to simple typo fixes, then please go ahead and create a pull request with the corresponding fixes. Contrarily, if the changes are more substantial (i.e. an additional page or considerable modification of an existing page like adding or changing a section), please bring it to the attention of any relevant people, and it will then be discussed to ensure the best outcome possible.

### Opening a Pull Request

Once a pull request is finished and ready, it will go through the normal review process and will eventually be merged into the `develop` branch.

## GitHub Wiki

As it is easier to make changes to the wiki, please feel free to do so as you see fit, while taking care to make sure that any documentation changed there that also exists here **must** be consistent (with this handbook being the source of truth).
