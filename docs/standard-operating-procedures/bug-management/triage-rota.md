# Triage Rota

The Triage Rota for Bug Management establishes a structured approach to handle reported bugs in the repository and Discord. The Triage Rota operates on a two-week rotation basis. Each rotation will consist of a pair of developers who will be responsible for bug triage.

## Scope

The Triage Rota covers the following areas:
- **Repository**: bug reports submitted through github.
- **Discord**: bug reports received via the designated Discord channels.

## Responsibilities

The developers assigned to the Triage Rota are responsible for the [Bug Triage](./bug-triage.md) during their assigned two-week period.
