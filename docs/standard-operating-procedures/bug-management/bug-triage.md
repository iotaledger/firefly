# SOP - Bug Triage

Bug triage is a process of identifying, categorising, and prioritising the bugs or issues reported by the customers or internal teams. It is important to have a standard operating procedure (SOP) for bug triage to ensure that all reported issues are addressed efficiently and effectively.

The following steps should be followed for bug triage:

## Step 1: Receiving the Bug Report

The first step of bug triage is to receive the bug report. The bug report can be received from various sources such as customers, internal teams, or automated testing tools.

## Step 2: Prioritisation

Once the bug report is received, it should be prioritised based on its severity and impact on the application. The severity of the bug can be categorised into four levels: critical, high, medium, and low. The impact of the bug can be categorised into three levels: high, medium, and low.

## Step 3: Assigning to the Right Team

Once the bug is prioritised, it should be assigned to the right team for resolution. The team should have the necessary skills and expertise to resolve the bug.

## Step 4: Fixing the Bug

The team should investigate the bug, identify the root cause, and fix the bug. Once the bug is fixed, the team should perform regression testing to ensure that the fix does not cause any other issues.

## Step 5: Verification and Closure

Once the bug is fixed, it should be verified by the quality assurance team to ensure that the bug is resolved. Once the bug is verified, it should be closed.

Having a standard operating procedure for bug triage ensures that all reported issues are addressed in a timely and efficient manner. It helps in prioritising the bugs based on their severity and impact, assigning them to the right team for resolution, and ensuring that the bugs are fixed and verified before closing them.
