# Bug Management

Welcome to the Firefly handbook standard operating procedures for bug management! Here you will find all of the information needed for our common bug management practices.

Bug management is a crucial part of software development, as it ensures the quality of the software and maintains a positive user experience. This standard operating procedure (SOP) outlines the bug management process to be followed by the development team.

## Identification

The first step in the bug management process is to identify a bug. Bugs can be identified through various means, such as user feedback, automated testing, or manual testing. Once a bug is identified, it should be reported immediately to the development team.

## Classification

The next step is to classify the bug based on its severity and priority. Severity is the impact of the bug on the software, while priority is the urgency of fixing the bug. Bugs can be classified into four categories - Critical, High, Medium, and Low.

## Documentation

Once the bug is identified and classified, it should be documented in a bug tracking system. The documentation should include the steps to reproduce the bug, the expected behaviour, and the actual behaviour.

## Assignment

The bug should then be assigned to a developer based on their expertise and workload. The assigned developer should acknowledge the bug and provide an estimated time to fix it.

## Fixing and Testing

The developer should then fix the bug and perform testing to ensure that the bug is resolved. The fixed code should also be reviewed by another developer to ensure that it does not introduce new bugs.

## Verification

After the bug is fixed and tested, it should be verified by the tester to ensure that the bug is indeed resolved. The tester should follow the documented steps to reproduce the bug and verify that it no longer occurs.

## Closure

Once the bug is verified, it can be closed in the bug tracking system. The closure should include the details of the fix, the verification results, and the date of closure.

## Conclusion

Following this SOP ensures that bugs are managed efficiently and effectively, resulting in high-quality software and a positive user experience.
