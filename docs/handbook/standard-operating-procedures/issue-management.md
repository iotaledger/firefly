# Issue Management

## Purpose
This document details the standard operating procedure (SOP) for maintaining issues that have been raised on GitHub; allowing all team members to remain consistent when organising and maintaining the issues backlog.

## Scope
This standard operating procedure is only applicable to maintainers of this repository responsible for the issues backlog; and the issues backlog is that which is found on GitHub only.

## Responsibilities
All members of the core firefly team are responsible for managing issues. If an issue is assigned to you, then it is your responsibility. For those issues without an assignee, we aim to follow a rota to ensure that someone is always responsible for new issues created. You will find an up to date rota below.

# Bug Management Process
The bug management process is to be followed when an issue is raised on GitHub that has the label `type:bug` or an existing issue has been given the label `type:bug`.

## High Level Overview
![Bug Triage Process - HLD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89913787/137463340-8bd8b95c-7dd6-4d36-96f1-8fd4af17643b.png)

The above diagram details the high level overview of the bug management processes:
1. Asses whether the issue issue is a valid.
2. Triage the issue.
3. Prioritize and schedule the issue to be fixed.
4. Fix the issue.

> **When managing issues please make sure you assign yourself to the issue on GitHub.**

## Assessment Process

The assessment process is usually followed as soon as an issue is labeled as `type:bug`, this is to ensure that we don't need to triage invalid issues. If you are on the Rota when this happens, you should assign yourself to the issue and then follow the above process as soon as possible.

## Triage Process

Once an issue has been assessed, we can then triage the issue to decide if we should fix the issue or if we just want to acknowledge the issue because we aren't planning to fix it. This should be done as soon as possible, by following the above process.

## Prioritise and Schedule Process

If an bug has been triaged and it is agreed that we should fix the issue, then we need to prioritise the fix and schedule this fix. Again this should be done as soon as possible after triaging, and can be done by following the above process.
