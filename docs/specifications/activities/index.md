# Activities

This section describes the Activity History, its generation and internal structure.
Due to IOTA's and Shimmers [UTXO](https://wiki.iota.org/IOTA-2.0-Research-Specifications/5.1UTXO) architecture, there is no 1:1 mapping between transactions and activities. Each output has to classified and has to be combined/hidden/updated in different cases. The main goal is to optimize UX by simplifying the complex UTXO architecture into a transaction based overview.
